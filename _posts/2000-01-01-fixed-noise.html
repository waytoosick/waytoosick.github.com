<h3>Recorded in several locations, "Fixed Noise" is a collection of many different experiences and genres and represents movement and change.</h3>

"This just in… straight from the mainframe… soon from the future… a chronical of NCB’s epic relocation to the greatest city mankind has ever seen… wild new sounds…. new wave, folk-tech, dragon slaying metal……. staying true to the roots of constant and ever-changing monotony….. watch out…. the time capsule from the future will arrive soon…………." An excerpt from the original wordpress blog post.

Fixed Noise is fucking crazy. Recorded in several locations, "Fixed Noise" is a collection of many different experiences and genres and represents movement and change. It contains new iterations of old songs, new songs, soundscapes, live recordings, stuff recorded in an old San Francisco apartment kitchen, stuff recorded in a garage.

This is the first batch of recordings to include the songs "Beowulf" and "Animal."
