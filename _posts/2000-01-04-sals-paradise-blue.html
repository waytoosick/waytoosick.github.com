<h3>This album is a demo and focuses on the electronic set of recordings.</h3>

<p>The concept for recording "Sal's Paradise" was to record the same set of songs in two different styles, one using acoustic instruments and the other using electronic. It was originally going to be released as a double album. The idea was that the song was an elusive concept, only captured in a recording, but nevertheless an intangible concept. That's really what a song is--a single instance of an intangible concept. So, the intention was that the listener would listen to both versions of the same set of song and develop a deeper understanding of the music. A parallax of song.</p>
