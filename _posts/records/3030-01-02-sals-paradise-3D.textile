<h3>The concept for recording the album was to record the same set of songs in two different styles, one using acoustic instruments and the other using electronic.</h3>

Sal's Paradise was a collection of songs written between about 2002 and 2010. The oldest of all of the songs was "Ignorance is bliss" and that ended up being the anchor, in both concept and melody.

The concept for recording the album was to record the same set of songs in two different styles, one using acoustic instruments and the other using electronic. It was originally going to be released as a double album. The idea was that the song was an elusive concept, only captured in a recording, but nevertheless an intangible concept. That's really what a song is--a single instance of an intangible concept. So, the intention was that the listener would listen to both versions of the same set of song and develop a deeper understanding of the music. A parallax of song.

This inspired a whole train of thought related to 3 dimensional art. During the recording process, the red and blue 3D glasses served as an inspiration for the music and the art to go along with it. The original demo recordings were titled "Sal's Paradise: RED" and "Sal's Paradise: BLUE." The red represented the acoustic versions (warmth) and the blue represented the electronic (cool). Those demos are available <a href="/records/sals-paradise-red">here</a> and <a href="/records/sals-paradise-blue">here</a>.

At the point that the demos were ready to publish, there was feedback provided by a trusted friend. The mix needed to be re-worked and even some tracks and layers needed to be re-recorded. At that point a decision to cherry pick the best tracks from each, and a focus to re-master the best tracks. Sal's Paradise 3D came out of the process. To reinforce the original red/blue concept, the track "ignorance is bliss" plays twice, the first time electronic and the second time acoustic.

The name Sal's Paradise is a reference to the character Sal Paradise in the book "on the road" by Jack Kerouac. The name eludes to the bliss that is described in the book and is an homage to the process that Kerouac used to write a story that had been brewing in his head for many years.

Released in April of 2010, Sal's Paradise is available on iTunes, Amazon, Spotify, Google Play, Shazam, and more.
