<h3>It's a basic playlist of songs that were recorded between 2000 and 2010.</h3>

<p>NCB's greatest hits is obviously a joke. NCB never had a single hit, let alone a collection of greatest hits. Instead it's a basic playlist of songs that were recorded between 2000 and 2010. The tracks go pretty deep.</p>

<p>As a riff on the "greatest hits" concept, the collection begins with "Own that shit" which has actually proven to be a greatest of hits (mostly as a party trick). The track sets out as a legit hip hop track about not selling out and for the most part fucking delivers.</p>

<p>The playlist meanders through various parts of NCB's journey ranging from hard rock to sad and quiet. Notable tracks include "Reflection," "Crunk Dust," and "Load up." Many of the tracks listed are early versions of songs that have made it into albums. For example, "Flux" is a very early version of "Ignorance is Bliss," which is the anchor track on "<a href='/records/sals-paradise-3d'>Sal's Paradise</a>."</p>

<p>The collection was put together at the time of Sal's Paradise to commemorate the ideas, sketches and history behind the music.</p>
